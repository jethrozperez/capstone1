## Clean and Load Data

## Capstone Exploratory Data Analysis 
## Summarize The Data
str(data2)
summary(data2)
data2$Date <- as.Date(data2$Date, format = "%m/%d/%y")

## Use DPLYR to detail advertiser spend, customers, etc..
advertiser_summary <- data2 %>% group_by(Advertiser) %>%
  summarize(total_spend = sum(as.numeric(Value), na.rm = TRUE), 
            sd_spend = sd(as.numeric(Value),na.rm = TRUE),
            total_customers = sum(Customers,na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(desc(total_spend), Advertiser) %>%
  mutate(rank = row_number())

## Filter Smaller Advertisers Out
advertiser_summary_big <- advertiser_summary %>%
         filter(rank <= 5)

advertiser_summary_big

## Use GGPLOT to Create some Visualizations
ggplot(data2, aes(x = Advertiser, y = Value)) + geom_boxplot()
## This Plot shows that Advertiser A should be viewed separetly because it has the largest variance
ggplot(data2, aes(x = Value, y = Customers)) + geom_point() + facet_wrap(~Advertiser,scales = "free_y")
## This Plot shows that We need to rething how advertisers spend influence customers when you facet by them. 
## as you can see only A and I capture any variance

## Clean up data for further Analysis 
advertiser_daily <- na.omit(data2) %>% 
  mutate(month = month(Date), year = year(Date))
  
colnames(advertiser_daily)[4] <- "Spend"
advertiser_daily<- na.omit(advertiser_daily)

## Analyze all but A, D, I
advertiser_daily %>% filter(!Advertiser %in% c("A","D","I")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Advertiser, y = Spend)) + geom_boxplot()

advertiser_daily %>% filter(!Advertiser %in% c("A","D","I")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Spend, y = Customers, col = Advertiser)) + geom_point() + facet_wrap(~month, scale = "free_y")

## Are there seasonal aspecst to my Data? 
library(zoo)
advertiser_daily %>% 
  select(Date, Customers) %>% 
  summarize(start_date = min(Date), end_date= max(Date))

advertiser_daily_ts <- advertiser_daily %>%
  select(Date, Customers) %>%
  group_by(Date) %>%
  summarize(Customers = sum(Customers))

View(advertiser_daily_ts)

ggplot(advertiser_daily_ts, aes(x = Date, y = Customers)) + geom_line()

## There is appears to be some seosonal aspects but are they a function of spend?
